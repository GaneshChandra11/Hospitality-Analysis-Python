### 📝 Introduction

Welcome to the **AtliQ Grands Hospitality Analysis** project! This project aims to provide valuable insights into the hospitality industry, focusing on **AtliQ Grands** — a prominent hotel chain operating in multiple Indian cities. Through data analysis and visualization, we strive to address the challenge of declining revenue and market share, ultimately helping AtliQ Grands make data-informed decisions to enhance its financial performance.

### ❓ Problem Statement

### 🔍 Data Cleaning and Transformation
Data quality is paramount in our analysis. This phase involves several critical steps:

- **Cleaning Invalid Data**: Identifying and rectifying issues such as negative values for the total count of persons.
- **Outlier Removal**: Ensuring data accuracy by detecting and eliminating outliers.
- **Creating New Columns**: Crafting metrics like occupancy percentage (successful bookings to actual capacity ratio).

### 💡 Insights Generation
Our analysis has uncovered several noteworthy insights:

- **Presidential Popularity**: "Presidential" rooms have the highest average occupancy rate (59.30%), highlighting their guest appeal.
- **City Standouts**: Delhi leads with the highest average occupancy rate (61.51%), while Bangalore lags behind (56.33%).
